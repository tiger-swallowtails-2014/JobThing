JobThing
========

It's a job thing! 

JobThing is an application to help you manage and organize your job hunt. 

Our MVP: 
* Have five columns - "Job Bucket", "Applied To", "Interview", "Misc", "Outcome", "Trash"
* A user can add a job to the "Job Bucket" list, and this will be his/her job reservoir. 
* A user can add a job to the "Applied" list, and it will automatically log the day this job was dragged to that column (as the date applied)
* A user can drag a job to the Interview column, and be prompted to enter his/her interview information (time, who they're interviewing with, day)
* A user can drag a job to the misc list, and add on any miscellaneous notes that they deem necessary
* A user can drag a job to the outcome list (in order to mark if the interview was a success or fail/ if they got an offer / etc) ... or if it was too much of a fail, they are free to drag the job in the trashcan icon in order to completely delete it. 



Stretch Goals:
* A user will get an e-mail update AFTER having interviewed, with a reminder to send a thank you note to his interviewer. 
* Job page should say how many days since they applied to the job
* Would eventually like the "job boxes" to be the company logos rather than just their websites
